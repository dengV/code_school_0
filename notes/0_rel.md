## What do 'link', 'rel', & 'href' stand for?

<hr>

In connecting an external CSS file, you have to assign: link, rel, & href. I'm wondering if these are short for something. p, for instance, is a shortening of paragraph. img is for image. Both are intuitive in their abbreviated forms.

<hr>

link is actually makes sense, since you are linking to a stylesheet. But what do rel and href stand for, and are these three terms used elsewhere in HTML?

rel is short for relation. It specifies the relation between the tag and href.

href stands for hypertext reference. It's the source of the file used by the tag.

You can use both not only when connecting an external css file, also for using <a> tags,for a regular hyperlink. Take a look at this site for more info.
